To test the chess board game you must use the runJUnitTests.bat and enter in the name of the test file (without the .java).
NOTE: This batch file only works on windows. If on linux/mac, please use JUnit as provided or open the .bat file and research the appropiate commands.

Running each test file and seeing if they pass assures that the logic of the game is sound.
All pieces have their own separate test file. Type the piece name followed by "Test"
eg: "PawnTest" or "BishopTest"
