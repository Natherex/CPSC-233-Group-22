### How to Play

To play, the user is prompted with a command console with a picture of the board state. Player One plays first.
To select a piece to move, type in the coordinate of the piece that corresponds to your color. (ie. Player One only selects white pieces, Player Two only selects black pieces)
After selecting a piece, type in the coordinate of the space you want to move your piece to.
If the piece selected matches the player and the move is valid, the play proceeds and the turn will swap to the opponent.
